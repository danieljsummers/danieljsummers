### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub home. It's not terribly fancy, but that makes it easy to clean!

While I have not shuttered everything here, I have moved major development of open-source software to Git hosted by Bit Badger Solutions. The majority of my projects are [released under the Bit Badger Solutions](https://git.bitbadger.solutions/bit-badger) name, though I do have [a personal profile there](https://git.bitbadger.solutions/danieljsummers) as well.
